# C# Workspaces

A few example workspaces for basic C#

## Prerequisites

Check if you have the .NET SDK by running this command on your command line:
```
dotnet
```

If you have the SDK, the command will return a message about usage. Move on to Installing.

If you don't, it will return an error message like: `'dotnet' is not recognized...` or `dotnet: command not found`. You'll need to download the .NET SDK. [Follow this Microsoft tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/install), then come back!
