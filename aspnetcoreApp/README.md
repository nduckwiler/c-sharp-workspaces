# ASP.NET Core App

This was created using a `dotnet` template:
```
dotnet new webapp -o aspnetcoreApp
```

On Windows or MacOS, trust the HTTPS development certificate with:
```
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

On Linux, you'll have to check the documentation for your Linux distribution.

Run the app with:
```
dotnet run
```

The web app can be viewed locally by going to https://localhost:5001 in your browser.

Microsoft has [its own tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/getting-started/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) to do the same thing.
